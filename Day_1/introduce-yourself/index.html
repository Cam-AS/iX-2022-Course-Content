        <p>A little bit about myself...</p>
        <p>
          I qualified as a Mechanical Engineer from the University of Pretoria
          and swiftly pivoted into Software Engineering. I really enjoyed
          studying Engineering but the workplace just didn't fit me right.
          Played all kinds of sports at school (except rugby) and still try to
          keep active these days.

          interviews we'd be unstoppable."
