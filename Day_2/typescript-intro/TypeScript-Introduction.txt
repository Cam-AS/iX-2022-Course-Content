TypeScript - Extending JavaScript

What it is & why would we use it?

 - Is is a so called superset to JavaScript, it extends JavaScript. 
 - TypeScript adds more features to the JS syntax
 - Most importantly it adds static Typing (JS is dynamically Typed)
 - With Typescript functions now know what Type to expect 
 - Static typing prevents ununecessary errors (sending in strings instead of numbers)
 - JS: function add(a, b) {} (dynamic type accepted)
 - TS: function add(a: number, b: number) {} (Now we expect a number)

npm init -y (Create package.json in project)
npm install typescript
We have to compile the TS into JS to see it in the browser
npx tsc intro.ts

Core Concepts & types

Primitives: numbers, strings, boolean are core types (null & undefined are used but differently)
More complex: arrays, objects

Type Inference
Function types, parameters, Classes
